        Thank you for visiting my post man like application. This is not a replacement for it nor 
        does it support all of its features. I didnâ€™t like the fact that I was limited to the amount 
        of requests I could make with it, so I created my own version. This app supports GET, POST (with Content-Type), 
        DELETE and UPDATE/PUT. Like every application this is not perfect and needs some TLC, but does everything that 
        I need it to do for my use cases, so if you have any suggestions please shoot me an email 
        at <a href="mailto:ararbi90@gmail.com">ararbi90@gmail.com</a>
        , or if you would like be become a contributor to any of my projects let me know as well. Here is the link to
        the repo <a href="https://github.com/ararbi90/Post-Man-Like-App" target="_blank">REPO</a><br /><br/>
      Regards,<br />
